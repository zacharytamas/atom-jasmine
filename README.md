# Jasmine for Atom

> Easily write Jasmine tests for your project in Atom.

## Install

```bash
$ apm install atom-jasmine
```

Or Settings ➔ Packages ➔ Search for `jasmine`

## Release Notes

### 0.3.0

* Adding more Expectation snippets. Modeling these after Pivotal's
  original plugin for TextMate. A very popular port to SublimeText
  has several thousand installs so these snippets and shortcuts are
  likely very well known. For those switching to Atom from either
  editor they should be ready to go out of the box.

### 0.1.0 - Initial release

*Note*: For initial release I've only added a couple quick snippets but have several things in mind that I'll be adding over time.
